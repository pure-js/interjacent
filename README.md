# interjacent
Just and one front-end framework named interjacent

The framework in first order is interesting because it was created for a regular - before grid web site and is an attempt to improve it. Compared to modern CSS frameworks there is not one, but many grids, which is a compromise between pixel and modern responsive layout. The main part of the icons here is also not in vector, but in an older solution - sprite. I've kept it here so that in the future, when I come across old websites, I can easily offer an alternative - a transitional framework as an example that it's possible to use components even in deprecated projects.
